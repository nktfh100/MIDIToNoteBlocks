Note that this is just an experiment I made for fun.


Limitations:
* Each MIDI file can only have one tempo, you can't change the tempo mid song.
* Since this is using vanilla minecraft note blocks there are some notes that it won't be able to play (replaced with bedrock)
* Notes between (F♯1 - F3) will use bass (wood)
Notes between (F♯3 - F♯5) will use piano/harp (grass block)
Notes between (G5 - F♯7) will use bell (gold block)
Notes below / higher than that will not be played.
* It cannot play more than 3 notes at the same time

How to use: 
1. Place your MIDI files inside the midi folder (inside the plugin's folder) 
2. Use "/midi" to open the selection GUI (You must be op to use) 
3. Select which MIDI file you would like it to build 
4. Check that the tempo shown matches your MIDI file tempo 
5. Wait a few seconds for it to build 
6. Done
